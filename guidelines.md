# Guidelines

## Project management guidelines

1. **Keep it simple**: Do not over engineer. Make elegant solutions. Exercise occam's razor.
2. **Do not add untill it works**: Only add functionality when existing one IS functional.
3. **Serve a purpose**: Every feature must serve a purpose in the finished product
4. **Kill your babies**: Destroy any intermediate steps or scripts that are not needed anymore.

## technical guidelines
