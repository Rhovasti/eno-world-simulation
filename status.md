# Project status

## Overall progress

âœ… **Autoticker Implementation Complete** - Advanced Alpha Phase  
âœ… **SpacetimeDB 1.2.0 Upgrade** - Performance and stability improvements  
âœ… **Real-time Synchronization** - Background operation with configurable tick rates  
âœ… **Enhanced CLI Tools** - Comprehensive autoticker commands and monitoring  

## Completed Features

### Core Autoticker System
- âœ… Real-time synchronized automatic time progression
- âœ… Configurable tick intervals (1 second to 1 hour real-time)
- âœ… 5 predefined tick rates (realtime, fast, very_fast, test, slow)
- âœ… Manual scheduling system compatible with SpacetimeDB 1.2.0
- âœ… Background operation - simulation runs continuously
- âœ… 8 new reducers for complete autoticker control
- âœ… Enhanced start-simulation.sh with 7 autoticker commands

### Technical Implementation
- âœ… Extended SimulationTime table with autoticker configuration
- âœ… AutotickerConfig table for precise timing control
- âœ… Thread-safe time advancement with timestamp synchronization
- âœ… Integration with existing hierarchical timing (individuals/buildings/cities)
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling and status monitoring

## What is next?

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Goal: Client Application Development
**Phase**: Alpha â†’ Beta  
**Timeline**: 4 weeks  

**Objective**: Develop a TypeScript client application using the SpacetimeDB SDK to enable AI agents in browser-based narrative games to query simulation data.

### Next Milestone Requirements
- Simulation uses own internal time that is 24 hours in day. 6 days in a week. 30 days in a month. 360 days in a year. There are two "leap year" occurances in a year where the hourly ticker goes on but the day cycle is halted for 60 hours. The aims is to have the 360 day year be in synch with the 365 day year of the real World. Every 4 years the leap year occurance is 72 hours.
- Based on location the time of day is different in every tick. There are 4 valleys. Valley of the Day, Valley of the Dusk, Valley of the Night and Valley of the Dawn. Day and Night are opposite and so are Dawn and Dusk so when it is daytime in the Valley of the day then it is Night time in the valley of the Night. When it is Day time in the valley of the Dusk then it is night time in the valley of the Dawn and dawn at valley of the day and dusk in valley of the night. Valleys are part of the same continent that is revolving in a constant pace and this is what makes the day/night cycle happen.

## Current Version Number

**v0.2.0** - Advanced Alpha with Autoticker

## Phase Descriptor

**Advanced Alpha Phase** - Core autoticker functionality complete, moving to client development

## Features to Move to Next Phase (Beta)

### Client Application Requirements âœ¨
1. **TypeScript SDK Integration**: Browser-based client using SpacetimeDB TypeScript SDK
2. **AI Agent Interface**: Query API for browser-based narrative games
3. **Location-based Queries**: Real-time and historical data for specific locations
4. **Time-based Queries**: Query simulation state at specific hours/days
5. **Narrative Integration**: Structured data suitable for AI storytelling systems

### Advanced Calendar System ðŸ“… 
1. **Custom Calendar**: 360-day year with leap year mechanics (60/72 hour pauses)
2. **Valley Time Zones**: 4-valley day/night cycle system implementation
3. **Location Mapping**: Assign 160+ cities to appropriate valleys
4. **Time-of-day Calculations**: Dynamic day/night based on valley rotation

### Beta Phase Success Criteria
